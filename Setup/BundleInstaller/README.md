The NTVS Bundle installer makes it convenient to get the tools you need to create Node.js apps targeting the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Instead of users having to install [Node.js (Chakra)](http://aka.ms/node-chakra-installer), 
and this IoT extension separately, they can use one installer.

##How to build the NTVS Bundle Installer
